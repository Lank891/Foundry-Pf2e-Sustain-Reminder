# Foundry Pf2e Sustain Reminder
A reminder about sustained spells that were cast.

Casting or showing a spell in chat creates an effect for the appropriate actor:

![PF2e Sustain Reminder - effect2](/readme-images/effect2.png)

Note: only one effect is created for a given actor, even if the spell was cast multiple times (e.g. 2 Laughing Fits on 2 different enemies).

If an appropriate setting is set, during combat each owner of a combatant (usually GM for NPC, GM and the player for PC), sees the reminder about all sustained spells:
