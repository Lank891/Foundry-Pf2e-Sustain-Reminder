# Foundry Pf2e Sustain Reminder
A reminder about sustained spells that were cast.

Casting or showing a spell in chat creates an effect for appropriate actor:

Note: only one effect is created for given actor, even if the spell was casted multiple times (e.g. 2 Laughing Fits on 2 different enemies).

If appropriate setting is set, during combat each owner of a combatant (usually GM for NPC, GM and the player for PC), the reminder about all sustained spells is shown:
